    <details>
    <summary>Test the Comments App UI</summary>
    >- Navigate to the URL `https://qacommentsapp.ccbp.tech/`
    >- Verify if the App image is displayed - _use Assertions_,
    >    - If the App image is not displayed, print "App image is not displayed"
    >- Verify the Heading text of the app - _use Assertions_
    >    - Expected text: `Comments`

    >- Close the browser window.
    </details>
    <details>
    <summary>Test the comment counter</summary>
    >- Navigate to the URL `https://qacommentsapp.ccbp.tech/`
    >- Add the comments from the dataset table.
    >- For each comment added, verify whether the comment count is updated respectively.
    >    - If the count does not match the expected count, print "Comments count do not match"
    >- Close the browser window.
    </details>
    <details>
    <summary>Test the comment initials</summary>
    >- Navigate to the URL `https://qacommentsapp.ccbp.tech/`
    >- Add the comments from the dataset table individually - _use DataProvider_.
    >- Verify whether the username initials are displayed properly.
    >    - If the initial does not match the expected initial, print "Initial do not match"
    >- Close the browser window.
    </details>
    <details>
    <summary>Test the comment order</summary>
    >- Navigate to the URL `https://qacommentsapp.ccbp.tech/`
    >- Add the comments from the dataset table.
    >- Verify whether the username and the comment are displayed in the order they are added.
    >    - If the order does not match the expected order, print "Order does not match"
    >    - If the comment does not correspond to the username, print "Comment does not correspond to the username"
